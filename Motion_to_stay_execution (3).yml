auto terms:
  physical or mental disability: |
    A disability can be a physical or mental impairment which significantly limits:
    * The housing that is appropriate for the person; or
    * The person's ability to seek new housing; or
    * The person's ability to care for herself, perform manual tasks, walk, see, hear, speak, breathe, learn, or work.
    **One does not have to be receiving disability benefits to be considered disabled for purposes of getting a Stay of Execution.**
  avoid an eviction: |
    For instance, if your damages (which may arise from counterclaims filed against the landlord) are less than the amount owed to the landlord (e.g. back rent), you have seven days to avoid eviction by paying the balance, with interest, and court costs. (M.G.L. c. 239, § 8A)
  Execution: |
    The Execution is the document that a landlord gives to a sheriff or constable, who then has the legal authority to move you out if you do not move on your own.

  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Motion_to_Stay_Execution
continue button field: Motion_to_stay_execution_intro
question: |
   Did you lose your eviction case? 
   Do you now need more time to move?
subquestion: |
  ### If you lost your eviction case or agreed in court to a judgment to move out and you need more time to move, you can ask a judge to postpone your eviction. To do this, **you must act fast and file the Stay of Execution with the court**.
  
  *This form helps you ask the court to allow you more time to find new housing.*
  
  Ten days after you lose your eviction case, your landlord is entitled to a legal paper from the court called an {Execution}. 
 
 
  **Note**: Even if 10 days have passed, you may still ask for a Stay of Execution. Keep in mind: the more time that passes, the more at risk you will be that the landlord will get an Execution and move you out.
  
  
  **A judge can allow you to stay a maximum of 6 months—or 12 months if you or someone in your household is over 60 or has a {physical or mental disability}.**
  
  
  A court may initially give you a shorter period of time and then allow you to file another motion if you need more time. The court also considers the hardship that your staying has on the landlord.
  
  
  ### If you are being evicted for non-payment of rent, you do not have any legal basis to request a stay. However, there are still ways to {avoid an eviction}.
